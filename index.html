  <b>Hors D’oeuvres</b>

     <p>Hors d’oeuvres are immediately different cocktails in that they can be served hot or cold, and come highly seasoned rather than with cocktail sauce. They’re also typically foods that can be served while talking, walking, and/or standing. While someone would sit and eat other appetizers like cocktails, hors d’oeuvres are perfect for walking around.</p>
